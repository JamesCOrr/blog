Hey, I’m James Orr. I’m a senior full stack engineer who loves mentoring, building cool stuff, and helping teams grow.

<br>

I’ve worked across the stack in fast paced startup environments and large enterprise systems, building green field projects and maintaining legacy systems. Along the way, I found that what I enjoy most isn’t just writing code — it’s helping other engineers grow. Whether it’s through mentoring, pair programming, or design review meetings, I enjoy being someone teammates can rely on.


<br>

I’ve led projects, coached junior engineers, and helped teams move from chaos to clarity. Along the way, I’ve picked up a few lessons (and a few scars) that I like to share here. These are things I wish someone had told me earlier in my career.

<br>

This blog is a place for honest insights, practical tips, and thoughts on leadership, mentorship, and becoming a better engineer by learning together.

<br>

Thanks for stopping by.
