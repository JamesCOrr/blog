title: Start Building

In today's attention economy, it is easy to get distracted from building and shipping projects. What starts as a simple plan ("let's build a blog!") quickly stalls while browsing the incredible creative personal sites that other devs have built. It's important to remind yourself that everyone starts small and builds up their skillset, and that the best way to reach those heights is to ship _something_. In my first article, I'm going to write about two of the common pitfalls I've experienced building projects, and how I strive to overcome them.

<br>

<h3>1. Analysis paralysis and the paradox of choice</h3>

Choosing the right technology to build your project can be a crucial decision. There's a reason that developers write at length about the tradeoffs of different technologies and why we discuss approaches to building large-scale systems in design interviews. I'm here to give you permission to build with _anything_. Are there tools that are harder, better, faster, stronger? Of course, but it is always possible to adapt in the future, and for personal projects, no one is going to care what technology you chose to write it in, they are going to care that you shipped something cool.

<br>

By removing the burden to choose the _right_ technology, you open up a floodgate of productivity and learning. Without actually geting into the weeds of a project, how are you going to know what problems you might run into? All the research in the world cannot substitute for rolling up your sleeves and wrestling with a new framework. You may find out that you hate the enforced conventions of a certain ORM framework. Or that you prefer more control over the internals of your system. All of this is impossible to unearth before you dive deep and build.

<h3>2. Comparison is the thief of joy </h3>

Building a project is an incredibly vulnerable experience. Developers have a tendency to espouse convictions based mostly on a narrow slice of lived experience with a certain toolset. I'm here to tell you that shipping a project with any toolset is a worthy pursuit and will give you real experience that allows you to articulate tradeoffs in a non-bombastic way.

<br>

This isn't the only thing that gets in the way of building, as I mentioned in the intro, it's very easy to see the incredible work of accomplished developers and compare yourself to them. "Why should I even make a blog when smarter, more experienced developers write better articles?" "How could I ever make something as visually creative as these incredible portfolio sites with interactive controls and animations?" All of these developers started somewhere, and built small, simple projects to get where they are today. It's important to focus your energy towards your own journey and growth. Acknowledge the small wins, and show up everyday. Before you know it, you'll be building incredible things.

<br>

These are things that I struggle with everyday, and I know that I'm not alone. If you're reading this, and grappling with either of these limiting beliefs, I implore you to pick something and start building. Bias towards action and consistent effort will lead to incredible results.
